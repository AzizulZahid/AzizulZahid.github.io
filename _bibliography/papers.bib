abstract = {In this research, we introduce NeuroCamTags, a battery-free platform designed to detect a range of rich human interactions and activities in entire rooms and floors without the need for batteries. The NeuroCamTag system comprises low-cost tags that harvest ambient light energy and utilize high-frequency modulation of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for wireless communication. These visual signals are captured by an available neuromorphic camera, which boasts temporal resolution and frame rates an order of magnitude higher than those of conventional cameras. We present an event processing pipeline that allows simultaneous localization and identification of multiple unique tags. NeuroCamTags offer a wide range of functionalities, providing battery-free wireless sensing for various physical stimuli, including changes in temperature, contact, button presses, key presses, and even sound cues. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate impressive accuracy at long ranges up to 200 feet. In addition to these findings, we consider a range of applications such as battery-free input devices, tracking of human movement, and long-range detection of human activities in various environments such as kitchens, workshops, etc. By reducing reliance on batteries, NeuroCamTags promotes eco-friendliness and opens doors to exciting possibilities in smart environment technology.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
